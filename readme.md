## About Solidity

Solidity is a high-level programming language used for writing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, with Ethereum being one of the most prominent ones. It is statically typed and supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types.

## Projects

Here are the projects included in this repository:

1. **[Project 1: Token Contract](/projects/token-contract)**  
   Description: A basic ERC20 token contract implementing the Ethereum token standard.
   
   ```solidity
   // Token contract code goes here
   ```
   
2. **[Project 2: Decentralized Voting App](/projects/decentralized-voting)**  
   Description: A decentralized voting application where votes are recorded on the blockchain.
   
   ```solidity
   // Voting contract code goes here
   ```
   
3. **[Project 3: Supply Chain Management](/projects/supply-chain)**  
   Description: A supply chain management system using smart contracts to track the movement of goods.
   
   ```solidity
   // Supply chain contract code goes here
   ```

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Solidity compiler
- Truffle framework
- Ganache (or any other Ethereum client for local blockchain development)

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solidity-learning.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd solidity-learning
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can then explore each project in its respective directory and run tests or deploy contracts as needed.
